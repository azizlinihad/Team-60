    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Team 60 was established at the beginning of the semester by our instructors and will continue to operate until the semester concludes. Our team consists of four members, all from the same CRN: Jeyhun, Laman, Nihad, and Faig. Together, we have accomplished impressive work and are committed to maintaining this momentum in the future.

        Throughout the semester, we have completed three significant assignments: constructing logic gates, participating in the Hour of Code initiative, and currently developing a website. In each of these projects, we pushed ourselves beyond our limits, demonstrating determination and resilience. Even when faced with setbacks, we persevered by trying repeatedly until we achieved success.

        For instance, during our first assignment—creating logic gates—we faced considerable challenges. Our initial attempt in the lab was far from successful. After an hour of trial and error, we experienced frustration and discouragement. However, we refused to let failure define us. Instead, we analyzed our mistakes, identified areas for improvement, and worked diligently to correct them. By the end of the assignment, we had successfully completed the task, showcasing our ability to learn and adapt.

        Our journey as Team 60 has been one of growth, collaboration, and resilience. With each assignment, we have honed our skills and deepened our teamwork, proving that persistence and a positive mindset can lead to remarkable achievements.
